     A holiday can have one import element or a combination of both definitions
     and code 
     "name"          is the localized name for the holiday, it must be set in
                     any case. Don't use english, except the local language
                     is english. Use the local description of the holiday
                     in your country.
     "international" is the english (international) well known name for the
                     holiday (optional). The local rules don't need to 
                     necessarily match with the well known english holiday.
     "valid"         determines whether the holiday is still valid or not
     "type"          currently free text, it can be anything, it further
                     describes the type of the holiday (e.g. legal holiday,
                     de facto legal holiday, katholic, etc.)
